# USA-Car-Dataset-Analysis

This analysis consisted of the Used Car dataset which has 12 columns and about 2500 observations. I broke this analysis down into two parts: Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models. I used Multiple Linear Regression to predict the price of a car using four features: mileage, year, title status and brand with my target variable, price. I used two models and the second model I standardized the variables (features and target variable) so they can have the same mean (0) and variance (1).
